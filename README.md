# chatbot-backend
Master's Project - IPGE Chatbot, powered by OpneAI

This is the backend Code for my OpenAI Powere Chatbot. Written in Node.js. This has REST APIs which is called by the bot UI to respond to student queries. Used OpenAI SDK for JS. 
The completed code is following the MVC design. Where in all the APIs go through controllers as first point of contact, and then the logic contains business logic for multiple queries by students on the bot.
